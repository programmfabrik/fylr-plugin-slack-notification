# slack-notifications

TODO: describe what this fylr plugin does.

## Building

Built by [fylr-build-plugin](https://github.com/programmfabrik/fylr-build-plugin) —
see there for how a fylr plugin is structured and what it can offer; the
Makefile is a thin shim, run `make` for the target list. For development,
point the fylr server at the build folder in `fylr.yml`:

```yaml
plugin:
    paths+:
        - ../slack-notifications/build
```

## Releasing

A manager publishes a release on the GitHub release page (tag `vX.Y.Z`); the
workflow builds the plugin zip and attaches it to the release.
